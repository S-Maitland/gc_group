## Notes

This site is responsive and dynamic, in order to achieve this `script.js` has functions that rference a source of truth for the books `books.json`
The links and the buttons on page have been setup to retrun alerts to indicate their use, as there was no requirements for redirects or further functionality.

To view this page you may have context on right-click of the file for a `view in browser` option, if using VSCODE then I suggest opening `index.html` and follownig this shortcut: `ALT + L, ALT + O` to open the page in your browser.

Fonts - Substituted `roca two` with `Poppins` and `FilsonPro` with `Raleway`
